# âž• Sum and Average of Array Elements

This Java program calculates and prints the sum and average of elements in predefined integer arrays.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

* Calculates the sum of all elements in a given array.
* Calculates the average of elements in another given array.
* Demonstrates use of `for` loop for summation.
* Demonstrates use of `while` loop for average calculation.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### Prerequisites

* Java installed (JDK 8 or higher)

### Steps

1. Save the code in a file named `SumandAverage.java`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   javac SumandAverage.java
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   java SumandAverage
   ```

## ðŸ’¡ Sample Output

```
Sum of all elements present in given array is: 14
Average of given elements in array is: 42.0
```

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used

* Arrays
* Looping constructs (`for` and `while`)
